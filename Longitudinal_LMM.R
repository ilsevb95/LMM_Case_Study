##### Set up analysis ####
# 1) Start with comparing different fixed effect parts 
#           - REML = F
#           - For each model check the assumptions (norm residuals, cooks distance, QQplot)
#           - Only add the random intercept
#           - compare models with the LRT/logLik -> models are nested
# 
# 2) Start adding more random effects and compare
#           - Add random slope and random pens
#           - REML = T
#           - Check assumptions (norm residuals, cooks distance, QQplot)
#           - Add different correlation structures
#           - Compare models with AIC/BIC

#### Comparing fixed effects ####

# Start with only Time and Group as fixed effects.
# Fit response with and without a transformation 
# log transformation results in better fit -> amount of var explained by random intercept bigger
